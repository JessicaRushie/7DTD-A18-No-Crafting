This is a MOD for 7 Days To Die Alpha 18.

This is inspired by "JaWoodle" aka "Josh" from YouTube.

It removes crafting from the game so you cannot craft anything.

This adds another level of difficulty as you have to loot everything including all building materials.
Yes thats right... all of them! However, if you can find Wood Frames or Rebar Frames you can use them however you like!

Just load into the game and in a few seconds you should get your 4 Points and the trader marker.

<HOW TO>
Simply place the unzipped file into your 7 Days To Die\Mods Folder.
EG, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"

The file it should look like this,
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessica's No Starter Quests\Config\quests.xml
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessica's No Starter Quests\Modinfo.xml
